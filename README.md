# OdysseyTrading

This is the Varsity Virtual Business app for the 2022-2023 year. 
Virtual Business is a school class in which the class creates a real-life business but in a virtual world.
The business this year was an enamel pin company.
I am the Chief Technology Officer for this year, and I created The Odyssey App.
The app enables customers to collect and trade virtual versions of Odyssey's pins. 
Users can trade pins with each other by scanning their friend's QR code, and the trade will automatically start. 
Pins can also be bought and opened directly in the app via a virtual cart system. The app can be downloaded on IOS.
